# Week 1: RRR Analysis Farmland and Vending Machines Projects on Avalanche

FarmLand & Vending Machine NFTs (on Avalanche) Reach, Retention, and
Revenue Exploratory Data Analysis
TARGET HYPOTHESIS
More gamified experiences available in Farmland positively correlate to greater reach and
retention with users, compared to Vending Machines NFTs.
OBJECTIVES
● Review FarmLand RRR SQL Queries and Visualizations
● Review Vending Machine NFTs RRR SQL Queries and Visualizations
● Determine Future Trends for GameFi on Avalanche from Analysis of FarmLand and
Vending Machines NFTs
INTRO
Farmland and Vending Machine NFTs are two of the top-ranked NFT projects on Avalanche.
Both offer an element of gamification and evolution of the NFTs that grows the users' assets
through automatically minting new NFTs over time and AVAX yields over time that increases the
longer the user holds the NFTs or through more engagement.
ACTIVE ADDRESSES OVER TIME (REACH)
● Farmland: From mid-Sept ‘22 to late Sept ‘22, the number of active accounts nearly
tripled. More than 12 times the active addresses observed in July 2022
● Vending Machines NFTs: Active addresses peak in July ‘22, and decrease by 90% by
Nov ‘22
TRANSACTION COUNT (REACH)
● Farmland: From mid-Sept ‘22 to late Sept ‘22, the transaction count quintuples. More
than 12 times the transaction count observed in July ‘22
● Vending Machines NFTs: Transaction count decreases significantly from July ‘22 to
Nov ‘22, decreasing by nearly 90%.
TRANSACTIONS PER ACTIVE ADDRESSES (REACH)
● Farmland: A similar trend is observed in the transactions per active address. More than
12 times the transactions per active address occur from July ‘22 to late September ‘22
● Vending Machines NFTs: Active addresses decrease significantly from July ‘22 to Sept
‘22, decreasing nearly 90%.
STICKINESS RATIO (RETENTION)
● Farmland: Apx 0.12 stickiness ratio
● Vending Machines NFTs: Apx 0.09 stickiness ratio
NEW V.S. EXISTING ADDRESSES (RETENTION)
● Farmland: After Feb ‘22, the new v.s. existing addresses drop by more than 90%, but
afterward, stay level in the following months
● Vending Machines NFTs: new v.s. existing addresses peak in Jan ‘22 and drop by
nearly 99% by Nov ‘22
MoM COHORT (RETENTION)
● Farmland: From Feb ‘22 to Oct ‘22, a significant drop in month-over-month cohort
retention is observed with 1/24 retention by Oct ‘22.
● Vending Machines NFTs: MoM cohort retention peaks in Feb ‘22 and drops by more
than 99% by Oct ‘22
AVERAGE GAS COST (REVENUE)
● Farmland: Average gas cost stays relatively close over the last quarter with Sept ‘22
being an exception and being significantly higher than the previous and following months
for gas cost.
● Vending Machines NFTs: Gas cost stays relatively level over the last quarter, excluding
mid-July ‘22, mid-Sept ‘22, and late Sept ‘22, where it surges.
WEEKLY TOTAL GAS COST (REVENUE)
● Farmland: Total gas weekly follows a similar trend, toggling around the same weekly
totals outside of Sept ‘22, where the weekly gas cost skyrockets
● Vending Machines NFTs: Total gas cost peaks in mid-July ‘22, decreases for some
time, and then increases for some time in Aug ‘22 and Sept ‘22
GAS PER ACTIVE ADDRESS (REVENUE)
● Farmland: From July ‘22 to late Sept ‘22 the gas per active address nearly multiplies by
7.
● Vending Machines NFTs: Active addresses peak in early July ‘22 and then once they
decrease they have remained stable over the past quarter and currently to around a 10
th of the number of active accounts
CONCLUSION
Across all measures for reach and retention, the Farmland NFT project has shown greater reach
and retention. However, it cannot be determined that this stronger performance is only due to
the different strategies in gamification employed by the two companies. Other factors, such as
sales channels, website performance, spending per customer, and other metrics are needed to
determine the strongest contributors to this performance.
