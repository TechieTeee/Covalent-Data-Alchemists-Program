In contrast to the previous trends observed, EGG/WAVAX by far has the
stickiest ratio, more than twice those of the other liquidity pools.
BTC.b/WVAX and WETH.e/WAVAX have comparable stickiness ratios, but less
than half of EGG/WAVAX.

During November '22, Trader Joe swaps are relatively even spread among
traders, except for November 9th and November 21 st.

# **ALLOCATION OF \$100,000 IN LIQUIDITY REWARDS**

Since the mean liquidity added over time for BTC.b/AVAX is trailing
significantly, the 100,00 reward could be used to add liquidity to the
BTC.b/AVAX pool to drive liquidity utilization and increase customer
loyalty to the liquidity pool.

# **CONCLUSION**

WAVAX/USDC and JOE/WAVAX did not have the most stickiness among the
liquidity pools, however, they were among the most stable in the
liquidity pool group.
